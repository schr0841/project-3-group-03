### Description 
This project aims to delve into the complexities of heart disease by analyzing datasets on heart disease indicators and the US population for the year 2022. By dissecting various indicators categorized by state, we construct an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using Postgres and conduct data analysis utilizing Python and SQL Alchemy to address our research questions.

### File contents
Resources folder: contains the cleaned files utilized as our database. The primary file hd_csv contains various indicators of heart disease segmented by state within the population estimate. The secondary file named "us-regions_census," houses the total population figures for each state.

Data folder:  contains the original csv files extracted from Kaggle and the census website.
Images folder:  contains various screenshots of our outputs.

### Database documentation
As a group, we were interested in working on a healthcare project, and we found this dataset to be large and suitable for our needs. We used pandas to clean up the data, Postgres to create an entity relationship diagram (ERD), and SQL Alchemy to run various queries and find answers to our questions.
### Data ethics
The data used during this project was all legal, and none of it included personal information.

### Description 
This project aims to delve into the complexities of heart disease by analyzing datasets on heart disease indicators and the US population for the year 2022.

The resources folder holds the cleaned constructed files utilized as our database. The primary file hd_csv contains various indicators of heart disease, including sleep duration, age, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, diabetes prevalence, etc., segmented by state within the population estimate. Additionally, we utilize a secondary file named "us-regions_census," which houses the total population figures for each state.

The data folder contains the original csv files extracted from Kaggle and the census website.
The images folder contains various screenshots of our outputs.
We use the Data engineering Track. 
The purpose of this work is to employ the ETL workflow to our database and transform the data in creating different tables usable for analysis in various languages (SQL, Python,etc.)
